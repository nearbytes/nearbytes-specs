# Nearbytes File Protocol v2

Superseded note:

1. this document records the pre-opaque event design line;
2. it is retained only as a historical snapshot;
3. the current unreleased design line is `application/file-events-v0.3.md`.

Status: draft normative specification.

Ordering status: non-final. Current implementations generally reconstruct file state using event timestamps such as `createdAt`, `deletedAt`, and `renamedAt`, together with deterministic tie-breakers. This is a temporary implementation rule rather than a final Nearbytes ordering specification.

This document defines the low-level file command model for Nearbytes hubs. It is the replay contract that turns an append-only hub log into the current file map.

Its scope is the event layer itself: file creation, deletion, rename, and replay semantics. It does not define higher-level command orchestration or standalone folder objects.

## 1. Scope

This specification defines:

1. the event model for the Nearbytes file-system layer;
2. a first-class `RENAME_FILE` log event;
3. replay semantics for path-like filenames and virtual folders.

This specification does not define:

1. standalone folder objects;
2. ACLs, locking, or concurrent merge policy;
3. filesystem mount behavior outside the event log.

Command note:

1. user-level commands such as upload, copy, paste, recipient-bound export, and folder rename orchestration are defined in `application/file-commands-v1.md`;
2. the enclosing hub model is defined in `application/hub-model-v1.md`.

## 2. Terms

1. **Logical filename**: UTF-8 path-like name stored in events, for example `photos/2026/a.jpg`.
2. **Virtual folder**: a UI/view concept derived from filename prefixes split on `/`.
3. **Current state**: the deterministic file map obtained by replaying the append-only hub log.
4. **Blob**: encrypted content block addressed by SHA-256 hash.

## 3. Data Model

Nearbytes stores files as:

1. encrypted blobs, content-addressed by `blobHash`;
2. signed hub-log events that bind logical filenames to blobs over time.

There are no standalone folder entries in v2. A folder exists only because filenames may contain `/`.

Example:

- `notes/todo.txt`
- `notes/archive/old.txt`

From these names, a client MAY present virtual folders `notes` and `notes/archive`.

## 4. Event Types

### 4.1 `CREATE_FILE`

Creates or overwrites a logical filename with a blob reference.

Required fields:

1. `type = "CREATE_FILE"`
2. `fileName`
3. `hash`
4. `encryptedKey`
5. `size`
6. `createdAt`

Optional fields:

1. `mimeType`

### 4.2 `DELETE_FILE`

Removes a logical filename from reconstructed state.

Required fields:

1. `type = "DELETE_FILE"`
2. `fileName`
3. `hash = EMPTY_HASH`
4. `encryptedKey = empty`
5. `deletedAt`

### 4.3 `RENAME_FILE`

Renames a single logical filename without changing the referenced blob.

Required fields:

1. `type = "RENAME_FILE"`
2. `fileName` = source logical filename
3. `toFileName` = destination logical filename
4. `hash = EMPTY_HASH`
5. `encryptedKey = empty`
6. `renamedAt`

Forbidden fields:

1. `size`
2. `mimeType`
3. `createdAt`
4. `deletedAt`

`RENAME_FILE` does not create a new blob and does not require blob re-upload.

## 5. Validity Rules

For `RENAME_FILE`:

1. `fileName` and `toFileName` MUST both be non-empty.
2. `fileName` and `toFileName` MUST NOT be equal.
3. replay MUST treat rename as a metadata move, not a copy.
4. if the source does not exist at replay time, the rename is a no-op.
5. if the destination already exists at replay time, the destination MUST be overwritten by the moved file.

Rule 5 matches existing event-sourced overwrite semantics used by `CREATE_FILE`.

## 6. Replay Semantics

Clients reconstruct file state by replaying events in the implementation's current deterministic order.

Today that commonly means timestamp-first replay using file-event timestamps and deterministic tie-breakers, but this behavior is non-final.

Under that temporary rule:

1. `CREATE_FILE(name, blob)` sets `state[name] = blob`.
2. `DELETE_FILE(name)` removes `state[name]`.
3. `RENAME_FILE(from, to)`:
   - if `state[from]` does not exist, do nothing;
   - otherwise move that entry to `to`;
   - remove `from`.

The moved metadata is:

1. `blobHash`
2. `size`
3. `mimeType`
4. original file creation time already associated with the file entry.

The rename event timestamp currently participates in replay in existing implementations, but that behavior is provisional. It still MUST NOT replace the file's own creation-time metadata in the materialized file entry.

## 7. Virtual Folder Behavior

Because folders are derived from path prefixes:

1. renaming a file across prefixes changes its apparent folder;
2. empty folders disappear automatically when no filenames remain under their prefix;
3. renaming a folder is syntactic sugar for applying file renames to every matching prefix.

So:

- file rename is a first-class log operation;
- folder rename remains a higher-level batch operation over path-prefixed filenames.

## 8. Wire Compatibility

v2 extends the event payload format with:

1. a new event discriminator `RENAME_FILE`;
2. `toFileName`;
3. `renamedAt`.

Readers that do not understand `RENAME_FILE` are not compatible with v2 logs and MUST fail closed.

## 9. Implementation Guidance

Writers SHOULD:

1. emit a single `RENAME_FILE` event for a single-file rename;
2. preserve existing blob references;
3. reject empty or identical names before signing.

Batch folder rename MAY be implemented by emitting one `RENAME_FILE` event per affected file.

## 10. Migration

Existing logs containing only `CREATE_FILE` and `DELETE_FILE` remain valid.

New logs that include `RENAME_FILE` require:

1. updated event deserialization;
2. updated state reconstruction;
3. updated timeline readers;
4. updated validation and signing logic.
