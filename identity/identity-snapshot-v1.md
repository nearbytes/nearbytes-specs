# Nearbytes Identity Snapshot v1 (`nb.identity.snapshot.v1`)

Status: draft normative specification.

Ordering status: non-final. Current implementations generally resolve snapshot recency using `publishedAt` plus deterministic tie-breakers. This is a temporary replay convention rather than a final ordering specification.

This document defines the record copied into a foreign volume when that volume needs a local, replayable view of an identity. A snapshot carries readable public profile data plus a precise reference back to the canonical identity-channel event it came from.

Its scope is this local materialization format. It is not the canonical identity log itself.

## 1. Scope

This specification defines a portable snapshot+reference record used to materialize identity state into a foreign volume while preserving a link back to the canonical identity channel.

## 2. Object Format

Minimal required object:

```json
{
  "p": "nb.identity.snapshot.v1",
  "k": "<identityPublicKeyHex>",
  "ts": 1731456000000,
  "ref": {
    "channel": "<identityPublicKeyHex>",
    "eventHash": "<64hex>"
  },
  "record": {
    "p": "nb.identity.record.v1",
    "k": "<identityPublicKeyHex>",
    "ts": 1731456000000,
    "profile": {
      "displayName": "Ada"
    },
    "sig": "<b64u>"
  },
  "sig": "<b64u>"
}
```

Field requirements:

1. `p` MUST be `nb.identity.snapshot.v1`.
2. `k` MUST be the identity public key.
3. `ts` MUST be a non-negative integer millisecond timestamp for the snapshot materialization.
4. `ref.channel` MUST equal the identity public key hex of the canonical identity channel.
5. `ref.eventHash` MUST be the outer event hash of the referenced identity-channel opaque event carrying the inner `APP_RECORD`.
6. `record` MUST be a valid `nb.identity.record.v1`.
7. `record.k` MUST equal `k`.
8. `sig` MUST be a valid signature by identity key `k` over the canonical JSON encoding of the object with `sig` omitted.

## 3. Publication Rules

Foreign volumes MUST emit identity snapshots as opaque signed outer events whose decrypted inner payload is `APP_RECORD` carrying:

1. `protocol = "nb.identity.snapshot.v1"`
2. `authorPublicKey = <identityPublicKeyHex>`
3. `record = canonical JSON string encoding of nb.identity.snapshot.v1`
4. `publishedAt`

The enclosing outer event MUST still be signed by the foreign volume key and remain semantically opaque at the storage layer.

## 4. Materialization Policy

Clients SHOULD append a new snapshot into a foreign volume only on explicit identity use, such as:

1. joining a chat with that identity;
2. sending a chat message with that identity;
3. future identity-authenticated actions in that volume.

Clients SHOULD append a new snapshot only if either:

1. the foreign volume has no valid snapshot for that identity; or
2. the latest valid local snapshot references an older identity-channel event or carries different profile data.

## 5. Replay Semantics

Within any foreign volume:

1. readers MUST group snapshots by `k`;
2. readers MUST order valid snapshots by the enclosing foreign hub's current replay convention;
3. the latest valid snapshot becomes the active local profile for that identity in that volume.

Older snapshots remain part of the foreign volume's history but are superseded by later ones.

In current implementations, `ts` and `publishedAt` may influence replay because timestamps are used as a temporary ordering aid. That behavior is provisional and non-final.
